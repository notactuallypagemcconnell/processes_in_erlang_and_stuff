## From the Rails 2.2 Release Notes

> 4 Thread Safety
> The work done to make Rails thread-safe is rolling out in Rails 2.2. Depending on your web server infrastructure, this means you can handle more requests with fewer copies of Rails in memory, leading to better server performance and higher utilization of multiple cores.

> To enable multithreaded dispatching in production mode of your application, add the following line in your config/environments/production.rb:

```
config.threadsafe!
```
