# What does this entail?

## Operating Systems arent the best at making processes, there is a lot over overhead.

### Concurrency can be had with processes, though.

### These are the rules of designing a COPL
A *C*oncurrency *O*riented *P*rogramming *L*anguage

1. (duh) Processes. A self-contained virtual machine.

2. A fault in one should not adversely effect another, unless this is explicitly programmed

3. A process must be ID'd by a unique unforgeable identifier

4. No shared state between processes

5. * Message passing is assumed to be unreliable with no guarantee of delivery*

6. We should be able to detect failure of another Process
